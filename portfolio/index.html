                                        <p>Developed and published by <a href="http://www.pillowcastlegames.com/">Pillow Castle Games</a> for PC, PlayStation, XBox and Switch, I worked with the team to create and develop the characters of both Dr. Glenn Pierce and the Standard Orientation Protocol, as well as write all dialogue in the game. I also directed the voiceover session and contributed to the overall narrative design and structure of the project. Recently, I completed writing on the 'Group Therapy' multiplayer update, and continue to work alongside the team on several other initiatives currently under NDA.</p>

										<h2>Guildmaster Story</h2>
										<p>Developed and published by myself for mobile and later ported to PC, <a href="https://willoneill.com/guildmasterstory/">Guildmaster Story</a> was my third project as an independent developer. A far more lighthearted title than my first two, it was praised by critics and players alike for its acidic sense of humour about unpaid internships, the silliness of spoiled rich adults, and how it played against tropes in the mobile puzzle game and RPG genres.</p>

										<h2>About the Game</h2>
									</header>
									<p><a href="http://www.planetoftheeyes.com" target="_blank">Planet of the Eyes</a> is a narrative-driven puzzle-platformer by Cococucumber. The game is available via Steam for Windows and Mac, as well as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

									<p>The game is between two and three hours in length, with a short, voice-acted script of approximately two-thousand words. It was built in Unity.</p>

									<p>I worked as the sole writer and narrative designer on this project in collaboration with art director Vanessa Chia and creative director Martin Gauvreau. Our collective efforts rendered us as finalists for Indie Game of the Year at the Canadian Videogame Awards.</p>

												<h3>A Dark(er) Mystery</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Working as the sole narrative designer and writer on the game, I was asked to take an initial retro sci-fi robot story and find a slightly heavier twist on it - one that would still pair well with a vivid and colourful visual style and fun, all-ages gameplay. I also needed to utilize an 'audiolog' system in which NPCs would never actually be encountered in-game.</p>

											<p>Ultimately, by creating a narrative that was about the distant connection between a lonely robot and an equally lonely stranded crew member, I was able to find heavy moments in a story and framework that was still thematically connected to themes of friendship and sacrifice.</p>

												<h3>Voiceover Direction</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In addition to conceptualizing the story and writing the script, I also personally directed the voiceover session of our narrator.</p>

											<p>While I had directed voiceover talent previously as part of my corporate and agency life, this was an invaluable experience to learn and grow that skillset in the dramatic context of a game, and the voice performance is a frequently-mentioned point of praise from both players and critics.</p>

												<h3>Working Well With Others</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Despite having no previous experience in writing a science-fiction game, Cococucumber was thrilled with my work in bringing their initially broad and high-level vision to life. Since then, they have continued to hire me to develop not only their next game - Riverbond - but also concepts for a variety of grant and other funding applications still in the works.</p>

											<p>Ultimately, I believe their continued desire to work with me is the best testament to my ability to develop narrative well not only for my own games, but for the work of the others as well.</p>

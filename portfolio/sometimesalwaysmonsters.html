										<h2>About the Game</h2>
									</header>
									<p><a href="http://www.vagabonddog.com/sam/" target="_blank">Sometimes Always Monsters</a> is a non-linear, narrative-focused adventure game by Vagabond Dog. It is the sequel to Always Sometimes Monsters, and continues the story of the player as a now-successful author in a contemporary setting. The game is planned for release in 2017, and will be published on Steam by Devolver Digital.</p>

									<p>I worked as a writer on this project under the management of studio owner and creative director Justin Armirkhani.</p>

												<h3>Bringing NPCs to Life</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My primary responsibility as a writer on SAM was to conceptualize and write storylines that take place between the NPC characters who join the player character as fellow writers on their bus tour journey.</p>

											<p>Utilizing only a high-level brief on who these characters were, I was tasked with not only fleshing them out, but figuring out interesting conflicts and relationships that could spring up between them.</p>

											<p>Initial drafts then led to closer collaboration, refinement, and final approval from the creative director.</p>

												<h3>Flavour and Phone Calls</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Another writing responsibility I took on for this project involved small shouts and throwaway lines from the various NPCs, as well as short telephone conversations that they would have with the player character to keep them on-track.</p>

												<h3>On The Road Again</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In addition to my writing, I've also worked closely with Vagabond Dog to market and promote the game. I joined them on a bus tour which travelled from Los Angeles to Seattle for PAX West 2016, promoting the game as we stopped in San Francisco and Portland along the way.</p>

											<p>On-site at PAX West, I worked closely with the team to speak with players and media as part of our exhibit at the Indie MEGABOOTH, utilizing my past experience with both Actual Sunlight and Planet of the Eyes at PAX East.</p>

											<p>Our journey was captured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmSNapVYdQs" target="_blank">short documentary</a>.</p>
